ROTH plans of all types have eliminated RMDs for the original account owner for years 2024 and later. <p>The frequency of distribution for RMD must occur at least annually. Yearly distribution amounts under RMD will vary. RMD rules vary depending on type of plan and employment status. RMD is subject to the terms of your qualified retirement plan. Plan terms may vary. <p>For accounts that require RMD, distributions are required for each year beginning in the year in which the taxpayer attains age 75 (or 70 1/2 if born before 7/1/1949, 72 if born 7/1/1949 to 12/31/1951, 73 if born 1/1/1951 to 1/1/1960). If the plan is a Qualified Plan and the taxpayer is still working and not an owner of the business, distributions can normally be delayed until the taxpayer retires. <p>This calculation is based on the elections you input. Any change to these elections will affect the amount of the distribution required each year. </div> ';
